Vectors. 

## INDEXING

```{r}
x <- c(6,4,7,12,21,0)
x[3]
```

```{r}
x[5] <- 89
```

The following sets y to be not the same thing but basically a copy of x:
```{r}
y <- x
```

```{r}
x[2] <- 33
```
x
y

Modifying x doesn't impact y (unlike in python and other programming languages). 

It is called a lazy copy: saying x and y are the same (y <- x) they actually are the same. But when I call the modification of one of the elements of either of them, a copy is created for the purpose. 

```{r}
x
x[c(2,2,1,4,5)]
```
This puts the number associated with each of the position written in c from x itself. 

```{r}
x[0]
```
Returns an empty numeric vector because index 0 has no meaning in R.
